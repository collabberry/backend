    <h1>Thank you for joining Collabberry!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi {{contributor_name}},<br>
      Collabberry is a tool that helps you manage your team's compensation and company ownership. 
      It is based on a dynamic ownership model where people accumulate team points over time based 
      on an initial agreement and regular 360 feedback.
    </p>
    <p>Here are 3 steps to get you started: <br><br>
        1. Invite your team members to the organisation - by sending them the invite link found on the Dashboard page<br>
        2. Input their individual agreements - only you as an admin can do that from the Team page after they join<br>
        3. Check and update your compensation settings - from the Settings page<br>
    </p>
        <p>
      After all is set, your round starts automatically. We will notify you via email when itâ€™s time for your team 
      to start the 360 assessment. After the assessment round is complete, you will be able to see every team member's 
      scores and allocation of monetary compensation and team points. You can mint the team points on-chain after that 
      from the page of the respective round.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have questions or need support with your team's onboarding, feel free to schedule a quick call<br>

    <p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
    <p>Best,<br>Collabberry Team</p>
